# LLFP - Lutron LEAP For Python
This is a python library for using Lutron's LEAP control protocol.
## Notice:
You are on this project's STABLE branch. All of the things here are supposed to work more reliably then in the master/dev branches. If you want the newest features, go there. If you want reliably, stay here.
## TODO

- [x] Get basic things (login, set level, ping, etc.)
- [ ] Make sure that things work correctly when they finally get implimented
- [ ] Add proper documentation
